# AWS Automation with Terraform, Jinja2, and Boto3

## Overview
Build a Python-based AWS Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool

## Features
- *Dynamic Terraform Configuration*: Uses Jinja2 templating to generate Terraform scripts.
- *Automated Deployment*: Terraform execution is managed through Python.
- *AWS Resource Validation*: Uses Boto3 to confirm EC2 instance and ALB deployment.
- *Error Handling & Modularization*: Functions and classes are well-structured with exception handling.
- *Infrastructure Cleanup*: Ability to destroy Terraform-managed resources when no longer needed.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Terraform
- AWS CLI (configured with credentials)
- Pip packages from requirements.txt

## Installation
First, clone the repository. No need to worry about dependenciesâ€”just run the script, and it will take care of installing everything you need.

## Usage
### Step 1: Configure AWS Credentials
Ensure AWS credentials are set up using the AWS CLI:
sh
aws configure


### Step 2: Run the Script
Execute the main script to start the deployment:
sh
python main.py

You will be prompted to enter:
- AMI selection (Ubuntu or Amazon Linux)
- Instance type (t3.small/t3.medium)
- Load Balancer name

### Step 3: Validate Deployment
After successful execution, the script generates aws_validation.json with details of the deployed resources:
json
{
    "instance_id": "i-0123456789abcdef0",
    "instance_state": "running",
    "public_ip": "3.92.102.45",
    "load_balancer_dns": "my-alb-123456.elb.amazonaws.com"
}


### Step 4: Destroy Infrastructure
To terminate all resources, select yes when prompted at the end of the execution, or manually run:
sh
terraform destroy

## Error Handling
- Handles invalid AWS regions, Terraform execution failures, and AWS API errors.
- Uses try-except blocks for better reliability.
